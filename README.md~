A few scripts that make using bash shell experience a little better

### Usage
You can load these scripts via running `source [script_name]` or you can add them in your `.bashrc`.
```bash
. [script_path]

# e.g. . ~/aliases.bash
```

### Note
In `math.bash` not all functions are "accurate". If you find any issue, please report it. In calculation, `bash` has it's own limitations.
Bash's limitation, that can only represent largesst signed 32-bit integer. `bc` on the other hand, can't perform floating point arithmetic.
Please avoid using computed results on a critical area.
